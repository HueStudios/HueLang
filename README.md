# HueLang

An imperative, stack-based language for the XV century, or something. 

## Inspiration

This project is heavily inspired by [nexustix](https://github.com/nexustix/reconn-c)'s [reconn](https://github.com/nexustix/reconn-c). You could say it's almost the same thing but with less bloat and with a more generalized formalization. In any case, he's the one who did the reading and the research so go blame him.

## Goals

- Be expandable. 
- Be fast.
- Be more expandable.
- Be domain specific to literally any domain or no domain at all.
- Be even more expandable.
- Did I mention it should be expandable?

## Nerd stuff

You can read the [language document](https://github.com/HueStudios/HueLang/blob/master/docs/language.md) to learn how the thing works, how to make an implementation of the thing, and maybe even how to write code for the thing.
